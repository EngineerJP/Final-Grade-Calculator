# Final-Grade-Calculator
Python program to calculate given students final grade percentage based off of Homework, Tests, Cengage, and Projects

# Introduction
I was asked to give my ideal percentages of my final grades broken down into multiple sections based on my Python course. The final percentages I chose was for my Homework Assignments to be 40% of my grade, the projects to be 20% of my grade, Cengage to be 20% of my grade, and Tests to take up the other 20%. This program will calculate a students grade based on those percentages and what is inputted for each section. Through using the algorithm the grades will result based on how the student did in each section and their final average grade will be outputted. 

# Requirements
Requirements of the code consist of taking the correct equations for the algorithm to run properly by finding the final grade percentage of the student. This will require there to be multiple input statements for the user to input an integer for each section for their grade. Along with equations calculating those grades based on the given values I mentioned in the introduction for the final percentage grade. 

# Pseudo Code
The first step in the code would consist of making input statements with given string values that can be used all throughout the algorithm. This will allow there to be input values, which we will use further within the algorithm. After we get the input statements, there will have to be a couple lines of code where we assign the values of the sections (Homework, Tests, Cengage, and Projects) with the given highest percentage possible. There should also be an if else statement or loop to make sure there isn't a number value given higher than the said percentage or lower than 0%. Then, there will be an equation that takes all the input statements and calculates them to make a final grade that will then be outputted by the system to the user. 

# Implementation and Testing
Testing and changing code based on any errors that are given back to the user after running the algorithm. Also, test the inputs and output values multiple times with different values to confirm that there are a minimal quantity of errors or miscalculations and then try to fix those.
